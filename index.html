        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, Iâ€™m Veronica Garcia, a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), majoring in Psychology. My ultimate goal is to become a psychiatrist, and my academic path is guided by a strong desire to understand how the mind works, especially in terms of how people think, feel, and act. I am committed to pursuing a career that allows me to help individuals struggling with mental health conditions, and I am excited about the journey ahead.<br><br>

        My interest in psychology began during my junior year of high school when I first encountered the subject as an option for an extracurricular class. A video describing the course caught my attention, asking, "Would you like to know how or why people think and the actions they take?" This simple question sparked my curiosity, and I began to see the value in understanding human behavior. Psychology fascinated me because it provides insight into not just the mind but also how the brain controls everything from thoughts to actions, including basic functions like breathing, sleep, and hunger. This blend of scientific inquiry and human experience is what drew me into psychology, and Iâ€™ve been passionate about it ever since.<br><br>
        
        At UCR, Iâ€™ve focused on building a solid academic foundation in psychology and participating in research studies to understand psychological concepts better. Although I havenâ€™t yet had hands-on experience in clinical settings like internships, Iâ€™ve been exploring potential career paths within the field of psychology. I have specifically become interested in pursuing psychiatry as a career because it offers the unique opportunity to combine my passion for understanding the brain with the ability to diagnose, treat, and manage mental health conditions. After researching various careers, I was drawn to psychiatry because it aligns with my desire to analyze brain scans, observe behaviors, identify disorders, prescribe medication, and provide therapy. The holistic approach to mental health treatment in psychiatry, which includes both medical and therapeutic interventions, is what inspires me to continue down this path.<br><br>
        
        In addition to my academic focus, I prioritize self-care by spending time with my family and also by engaging in personal activities like listening to music, reading, and watching movies. These activities help me recharge and maintain a healthy balance between my studies and personal life, which is essential for my overall well-being. I also enjoy reflecting on how psychology is all around us, whether in advertising, where emotional responses are evoked through color and celebrity endorsements, or in everyday interactions within my family. Psychology is a field that touches every aspect of life, and it motivates me to continue learning and helping others.<br><br>
        
        Looking forward, I plan to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in psychology before applying to medical school to become a psychiatrist. My goal is to specialize in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions and providing care that helps individuals lead better, more fulfilling lives. Psychology, for me, is not just an academic subjectâ€”itâ€™s a path that allows me to understand and improve the well-being of others. I am excited to further explore the intricate relationship between the brain, behavior, and mental health as I continue my studies at UCR and work toward becoming a psychiatrist.<br><br>
